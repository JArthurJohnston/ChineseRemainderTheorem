A project for encoding and decoding text using various cyphers. This was done for my Applied Cryptography class. All the code was written in smalltalk

#Usage

If you have not already done so, go to the Pharo website: http://pharo.org/ and follow their instructions to download and set up Pharo on your operating system.
